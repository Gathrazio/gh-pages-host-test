                            I am most recently fluent with Python, T-SQL, & Microsoft SQL Server software. I have also spent considerable time improving my skills with React.js, working with various backend technologies (like MongoDB, GridFS, Node.js, Express.js, JWT authentication, O-Auth 2.0, and Python frameworks like Django & Flask). I have effectively utilized Git and Github to work on personal and production projects. I also have over four years of intense practice in the math typesetting software LaTeX, and have a deep understanding of upper division collegiate mathematics. Really everything from statistics, linear algebra, calculus, number theory, discrete mathematics, and topology. My work in school focused on braids and knots -- essentially combinatorial topology. I spent considerable time building educational materials for calculus, statistics, and discrete math courses.

                            I graduated from USU with a Bachelors of Science degree in Mathematics with the Summa Cum Laude disctinction in May of 2022 (<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NnAjKZPGiPNixASZUuMd4Qp4QUIwAW7m?usp=sharing" target="_blank">view some of my work as a student and educator</a>). The deductive reasoning skills, problem solving methods, quantitative writing skills, and perseverance I gained from this degree has been incredibly important for my personal growth. I want to someday do something fantastical -- to push humanity's knowledge forward in some capacity. In particular, I desire to break through and solve the problem of artificial general intelligence (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence" target="_blank">AGI</a>). For that purpose as well my degree stands as support.

                            The live projects may take approximately 60 seconds to spin up due to the hosting service's limitations. I built these projects during my 1000+ hour V School education and during the IBM 12-month backend development professional certificate. All of these projects (sans the Djirection site) were brainstormed, designed, implemented, debugged, and deployed by me alone (i.e., no templates or UI libraries). I learned many invaluable lessons about React component tree structure, the benefits and demerits of using React context, the appropriate usage patterns of React State, and intelligent utilizations of useEffect and other React hooks having to do with interacting with data and controlling page views.

Suppose you chose some hand out of the five -- it doesn't matter which. Since each hand has a score of 2, you will win if the house chooses 2 out of the 5 hands. So the probability of winning is 2/5, or 40%. In the case of Bernoulli random variables, the expected value is exactly this probability of success: 2/5. And it just so happens that the law of large numbers says that the average of the instances of a random variable, as the number of trials goes to infinity, will be close to and approach the expected value.
